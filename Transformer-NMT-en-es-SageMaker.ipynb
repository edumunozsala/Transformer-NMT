    "By default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will store the code that we write in the `serve` directory. Provided in this directory is the `model.py` file that we used to construct our model, a `utils.py` file which contains the `one-hot-encode` and `encode_text` pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and `predict.py`, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that `requirements.txt` is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.\n",

    "When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.\n",
    " - `model_fn`: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model. This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. It also reads the saved dictionaries because they could be used during the inference process.\n",
    " - `input_fn`: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code. Latter we will mention what our input_fn function is doing.\n",
    " - `output_fn`: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.\n",
    " - `predict_fn`: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the simple example that we are constructing during this project, the `input_fn` and `output_fn` methods are relatively straightforward. We require being able to accept a string as input, *composed by the desired length of the output and the initial string*. And we expect to return a single string as output, the new text generated. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.\n",

In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.\n",
